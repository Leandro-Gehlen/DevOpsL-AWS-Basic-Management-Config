## 1Â° Step - Creating a root account on AWS

> #### *Must have*
> 
> - I had to create a new email account so I can create a test root user on AWS.
> - IÂ´ve also created a .gitignore file and set .env to be ignored.
> - So, after a new email for testing purpose has been created, letÂ´s create a brand new root account on aws.
> - After fill in your email and password, choose the free plan.

## 2Â° Step - Avoid Over Billing by setting Budgets and Billing alarms

- Make sure you are on us-east-1 (Virginia). Beacuse some services configurations might not work on other regions. 
- Once you have reached the AWS Management Console page, we now will configure the budget alert.
- Click on your root name and go to my billing dashboard.
- If , like mine, your aws dashboard was automatically translated to your mother language, search for the respective translation.

### Setting Billing alerts
-------------------------
ThatÂ´s where you gonna find the aws billing dashboard. Just click on it to go.

### AWS Budget

- Search for budget and go to AWS Budget.
- Create a new Budget
- By creating a Budget you will be able to know if your AWS account reached you budget and be alerted about it.
- The zero cost budget is the recommended to those that are just learning.
- After have your new budget created the screen will be looking like bellow.
